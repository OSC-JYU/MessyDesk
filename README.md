# MessyDesk

## Digital Humanities Desktop

This is a VERY early version of MessyDesk, a digital humanities desktop (for humanists).

The idea is that you can collect, organise and process your materials easily by experimenting with different kind of options.

Things you can do:
- extract images and text from PDF
- process images
- do optical character recognition
- do different kind of text and images analysis
- and so on... 

### status

Development in progress.


### How does it work?

MessyDesk provides intuitive user interface for rapid testing of different kind of services. Services run locally, in nomad cluster or externally. 

### Service adapters

Service adapters are links between MessyDesk backend and services. They translates requests from MessyDesk to the API that service implements.
