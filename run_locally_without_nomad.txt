Aim your browser to http://localhost:3000

You should have an user interface but you can't do much. You can upload files but you don't get even thumbnails for images or PDFs.

Let's start some basic tools.

Image thumbnailer:

Open yet another terminal and start imaginary container

	docker run -d --name md-thumbnailer -p 9000:9000 nextcloud/aio-imaginary

Now we should have imaginary (that is used for image thumbnails) running in port 9000.
Now we must start adapter, that connects service to MessyDesk.

	cd MD-consumers

	TOPIC=md-thumbnailer DEV_URL=http://localhost:9000 node src/index.mjs
