What happend when user clicks "Crunch"

1. Request is made to queue endpoint

post('/api/queue/:topic/files/:file_rid'

1.1. Endpoint creates a Process node to database.

1.2. Based on RID of process node, a directory is created for node
1.3 Request body is written to a file (params.json) under that directory
1.4 UI is updated so that process node is displayd (send2UI)

1.5 IF process has attribute "output_set", then output Set is created
1.6 UI is updated so that also Set node is displayd (send2UI)

2. Message is published to stream

nats.publish(topic, JSON.stringify(ctx.request.body))



3. Stream consumer app gets the Message (MD-consumers)

3.1 Consumer app calls processing endpoint
3.1.1 Consumer app streams file to endpoint with params

3.2 When endpoint responses, the consumer app donwloads files from processing endpoint and send them to MessyDesk 
    post('/api/nomad/process/files')

4. MessyDesk receives files
IF file is thumbnail
    then save file as thubnail file to the node path
ELSE
4.1 A File Node is created and a node path is created
4.2 File is saved in node path
4.3 UI is updated
4.4 send file to thumbnailer queue


Image upload:

1. File node is created
2. File node directory is created
3. File is saved under that directory.
4. File is sent to thumbnailer queue

Additional step for images with EXIF rotation:

Image file is sent to image-info service, which return dimensions, type and exif orientation.
If orientation is found and it is not 1, then image is sent to autorotate-endpoint of md-imaginary service. This image is then saved to the same directory as original file but with suffic '_exif_rot'.
